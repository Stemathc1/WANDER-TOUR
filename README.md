Data Gallery App
Overview:
Created a React application that displays a gallery of different data points fetched from an API. The application includes a main page with a gallery view and a detailed view for individual data points.
Features:
1.	Gallery Component:
o	Created a gallery component that displays a grid or list of data points fetched from the chosen API. Each data point represented as a card or an item in the gallery.
2.	Detail Component:
o	Implemented a detail component that displays more detailed information about a specific data point. This component displayed when a user clicks on an item in the gallery.
3.	API Integration:
o	Choose an API that provides data of interest:https://ghibliapi.vercel.app/
o	Fetched data from the API and populate the gallery with items representing each data point.
4.	Navigation:
o	Used React Router to enable navigation between the gallery view and the detail view. The URL should change to reflect the current view, and users should be able to navigate back to the gallery from the detail view.
•	Added a search or filter feature to the gallery to allow users to narrow down the displayed data points.
•	Implemented pagination or infinite scrolling in the gallery to handle large sets of data.
•	Enhanced the detail view with additional information or interactive elements related to the selected data point.
